Hey there!
Welcome to my blog. My name is Negar and I'm an adventorous and active person who likes experiencing new stuff. I beleive everybody has one chance to live their life as they want and get the most out of it, and I am always on the lookout for big changes new and exciting experiences. Whether it's traveling to a new place, changing my job, trying a new sport or learning something new, I am always up for a challenge.
I have recently started learning to code which has opened up a whole new world to me. Despite all the struggles and confusions (I bet you know what I'm talking about!) I enjoy every minute of this journey and I'm eager to share this experience with others and write about my thoughts and new skills which I learn day by day!
