My ToDo list project is a simple todo list that is built using React. Building this project helped me learn the basics of building React applications such as making components, using different React hooks like useState and Effect and how to store data as key-value pairs inside a browser using localStorage.
This ToDo React application allows users to create a new task list. Also they can delete and edit tasks by clicking on the corresponding icons and mark them as done by clicking on the checkbox next to the task.
