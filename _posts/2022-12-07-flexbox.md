There are probably countless ways for aligning items out there but this time I'm using flexbox which lets us align anything (vertically or horizontally) quite painlessly!
The only thing we need to do is to put our items in a flex div and choose how we want to arrange them by chosing a main axis and changing other available options.

[This useful article](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) helped me alot to understand flexbox principals.

Here you can find a simple example of using flexbox to align a form and an image inside a page.
