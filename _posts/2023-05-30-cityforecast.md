In this blog post, I am excited to introduce City Forecast, a weather application that I had the opportunity to develop using React and incorporate with Axios. City Forecast aims to be a user-friendly solution for accessing real-time weather information for cities worldwide. By leveraging the capabilities of the OpenWeather API, the app provides users with accurate weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, and more. City Forecast offers a delightful weather forecasting experience with its intuitive interface and seamless functionality.
To create City Forecast, I integrated Axios to handle HTTP requests and retrieve data from the OpenWeather API in an efficient and organized manner.
